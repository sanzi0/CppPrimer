# C++ Primer Solutions
I'm a beginner in programming starting with C++. Generally, I have no idea what's going on, but these answers are correct. Some of them are quite repetitive. It's because I'm being intentionally verbose, to reiterate this stuff in my head. I'll keep updating this as I steadily work my way through this awesome book.

To run these, I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019. You can download it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), install it normally (if you're having trouble, try [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160)) and choose the workloads related to C++ development. There, it should work right out of the box. I'm not going to risk saying anything else about what compiler exactly is being used, for I don't even know what a compiler is yet.
