### [Exercise 1.1](/Chapter%201/Section%201.1/ex1.1.cpp)
Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/cl-filename-syntax?view=msvc-160). 
>The filename extension determines how files are processed. C and C++ files, which have the extension .c, .cxx, or .cpp, are compiled. Other files, including .obj files, 
>libraries (.lib), and module-definition (.def) files, are passed to the linker without being processed.

### [Exercise 1.2](/Chapter%201/Section%201.1/ex1.2.cpp) 
Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun 
your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.
