### [Exercise 2.40](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/Sales_data.h)
#### Write your own version of the `Sales_data` class.
Note: The book wants you to write the `Sales_data` class within the `main` function of your program at this moment. They'll talk about actually creating your header files after the end of the next section of exercises. `Sales_data.h` will be our own version of the original, more elaborated `Sales_item.h` provided by the authors.

<br/>

## Exercises Section 2.6.2
### Exercise 2.41
#### Use your `Sales_data` class to rewrite the exercises in ยง [1.5.1](/Chapter%201/Section%201.5#exercises-section-151) (p. 22), ยง [1.5.2](/Chapter%201/Section%201.5#exercises-section-152) (p. 24), and ยง [1.6](/Chapter%201/Section%201.6#exercises-section-16) (p. 25). For now, you should define your `Sales_data` class in the same file as your main function.

##### [Set of transactions](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.41-a.cpp), [ISBN sum 1](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.41-b.cpp), [ISBN sum 2](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.41-c.cpp), [counter](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.41-d.cpp) <br/>
###### Test the previous program by giving multiple transactions representing multiple ISBNs. The records for each ISBN should be grouped together.

##### [Set of transactions](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.42-a.cpp), [ISBN sum 1](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.42-b.cpp), [ISBN sum 2](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.42-c.cpp), [counter](/Chapter%202/Section%202.6/ex2.42-d.cpp) <br/>
